A simple website that allows comments, one after another, with a text box at the bottom so that people can add new ones. All of those comments are being stored in a database:

A web app in Flask, like most frameworks, consists of two kinds of files: source code, which is written in Python, and templates, which are written in an extended version of HTML. The source code says what the web app should do, and the templates say how it should be displayed.

- Apply Python, Flask, and MySQL knowledge to create own website
- Create and apply Git as a source of control for the Web App
